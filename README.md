Step 1: Import Data into Power BI

    Open Power BI Desktop.
    Click on Home > Get Data.
    Select the appropriate data source (Excel, SQL Server, CSV, etc.).
    Load the datasets needed for your analysis.

Step 2: Data Transformation (Power Query Editor)

    Click Transform Data to open the Power Query Editor.
    Perform necessary data cleaning steps:
        Remove duplicates
        Rename columns for clarity
        Change data types (dates, numbers, categories)
        Merge or append queries if needed
    Apply transformations like:
        Creating calculated columns
        Extracting date components (Year, Month, Day)
        Handling missing values
    Click Close & Apply to load the cleaned data into Power BI.

Step 3: Define Relationships

    Go to the Model View.
    Check and establish relationships between tables (e.g., one-to-many relationships).
    Drag and drop fields to connect them properly.
    Ensure relationships use the correct keys (e.g., PatientID, Date, RegionID).

Step 4: Create DAX Measures and Calculated Columns
1. Prevalence Rate (DAX Formula)

Prevalence Rate is calculated as the number of existing cases per total population at a given time.

Prevalence Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    SUM(HealthData[Active Cases]), 
    SUM(HealthData[Total Population]), 
    0
)

    Active Cases: Number of ongoing cases at a specific time.
    Total Population: The total number of individuals in the region.

2. Correlation (DAX Formula)

To calculate correlation between two variables (e.g., Cases & Fatalities), we use Pearson’s correlation coefficient.

Correlation = 
VAR MeanX = AVERAGE(HealthData[Cases])
VAR MeanY = AVERAGE(HealthData[Fatalities])

VAR Covariance = 
    SUMX(
        HealthData, 
        ([Cases] - MeanX) * ([Fatalities] - MeanY)
    )

VAR StdDevX = STDEV.P(HealthData[Cases])
VAR StdDevY = STDEV.P(HealthData[Fatalities])

RETURN 
    DIVIDE(Covariance, StdDevX * StdDevY, 0)

    This formula calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between Cases and Fatalities.
    Values range from -1 (negative correlation) to +1 (positive correlation).

3. Case Fatality Rate (DAX Formula)

The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is the proportion of deaths among confirmed cases.

Case Fatality Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    SUM(HealthData[Deaths]), 
    SUM(HealthData[Cases]), 
    0
)

    Deaths: Total number of deaths due to the condition.
    Cases: Total confirmed cases.
    Interpretation: A higher CFR indicates a more severe outbreak or poor treatment outcomes.

Step 5: Build Dashboards (Reports)

    Select Visuals:
        Prevalence Rate → Card visual
        Correlation → Scatter plot
        Case Fatality Rate → Line chart
        Other comparisons → Bar charts, tables, maps

    Add Filters and Slicers:
        Create Date Slicers for time-based filtering.
        Add Region Filters for geographical insights.

    Format the Dashboard:
        Adjust colors, fonts, and labels for readability.
        Use tooltips to provide additional information.
        Set up drill-through pages for deeper analysis.

Step 6: Add Interactivity

    Use Bookmarks to create different dashboard views.
    Set up Drill-through Pages for deeper analysis.
    Enable Cross-filtering between visuals.

Step 7: Publish and Share

    Click File > Publish to Power BI Service.
    Assign appropriate permissions for sharing.
    Schedule data refreshes (if applicable).
